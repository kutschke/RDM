Abstract
\end{center}
\medskip

This document describes background information
that is needed to design the Mu2e Data Logging System.
It describes how the Data Logging system fits into
Data Processing and Computing L2 project of the Mu2e Operations Plan.
It describes the many different files that will be produced by the online system;
it describes technical constraints that must be obeyed by the system;
it lists questions that need to be answered during the design process;
and it identifies which of the above information may change as the
design of the design of Mu2e Operations evolves.
