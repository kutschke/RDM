Abstract
\end{center}
\medskip

The purpose of the Mu2e Data Logging system is to move data
that is produced by the online system to long term storage offline;
for most data the long term storae will be files on tape
but for some data it may be offline databases.
This document describes the background information
that is needed to design the Mu2e Data Logging System.
In particular it describes
the many different files that will be produced by the online system.
It describes technical constraints that must be obeyed by the system
and lists questions that need to be answered during the design process.
It also identifies which of the above information may change as the
design of the online system evolves.
