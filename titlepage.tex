Abstract
\end{center}
\medskip

This document presents background information
that is needed to design the Mu2e Raw Data Mover (RDM) system,
whose main function is to move data from a disk buffer
in the online system to long term storage.
It describes the many different files that will be produced by the online system
and the differences in how they need to be handled;
it describes technical constraints that must be obeyed by the system;
it lists questions that need to be answered during the design process;
and it concludes with the requirements for the RDM.
There are appendices
that describe information collected from the Mu2e subsystems.
