\chapter{Looking for a Home}
\label{app:LookingForaHome}

Some ideas that belong somewhere but I am not sure where;
maybe not even in this document.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Material from email thread with Ryan Rivera in July 2021,
  with subject ``Making sure that I understand off-spill running''
\item Need to have a discussion with Eric about compactEventRanges;
  see email thread with Ray in Oct 2021 with the subject
  ``large RootFileDB in raw data files''.
\item Do we need to import any information from building databases?
  It's not clear if we want any of this.
  The DB names are Metasys and PME.
  See email exchange on Nov 18, 2021 with Andy Martens and Greg Rakness,
  with the subject ``Metasys and PME database limits''.
\end{enumerate}
